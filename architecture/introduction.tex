When approaching a problem with a machine learning solution in mind, the first decision one has to deliberate on is the choice of network architecture used. 

In the case of neural networks, the word \emph{architecture} means which kind of layers are connected to each other in what order to produce the output of the network.

The landscape of machine learning architectures has become incredibly diverse, with improvements being made constantly.
Since some architectures are better suited for certain problems or priorities, which architecture one chooses has a significant impact on the results.

In this section, an overview over the architectures used in the thesis and their main ideas will be given.
