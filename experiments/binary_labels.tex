\section{Binary instead of multi-class segmentation}
\label{sec:binary}

In \ref{sec:algorithm} it's stated that training the model to segement the image into three different classes helps to filter out common model errors in later stages of the measurement algorithm. 
However, introducing a third class also makes the problem more difficult to learn. It could be that training the model on only two classes (background and in-focus droplet) would enable the model to avoid the errors in the first place, since it can learn the criterium for a droplet bein in focus more easily.

To test this, the model is trained on the vapour dataset, but with all different droplet labels combined into a single class. The model is then evaluated on the test set that underwent the same transformation. 

During the evaluation process, the filtering step performed by the droplet measurement algorithm is obviously skipped, since the inside labels don't exist anymore. 

Training parameters are the same as in \ref{sec:mean_teacher_general}.
