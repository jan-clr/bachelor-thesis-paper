  abstract = {Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) have the potential to become the basis for a wide gamut of labon-a-chips (LoCs). These mechanical waves are among the most promising physics that can be exploited for fulfilling all the requirements of commercially appealing devices that aim to replace\textendash or help\textendash laboratory facilities. These requirements are low processing cost of the devices, scalable production, controllable physics, large flexibility of tasks to perform, easy device miniaturization. To date, SAWs are among the small set of technologies able to both manipulate and analyze biological liquids with high performance. Therefore, they address the main needs of microfluidics and biosensing. To this purpose, the use of high-frequency SAWs is key. In the ultra-high-frequency regime (UHF, 300 MHz\textemdash 3 GHz) SAWs exhibit large sensitivities to molecule adsorption and unparalleled fluid manipulation capabilities, together with overall device miniaturization. The UHF-SAW technology is expected to be the realm for the development of complex, reliable, fully automated, high-performance LoCs. In this review, we present the most recent works on UHF-SAWs for microfluidics and biosensing, with a particular focus on the LoC application. We derive the relevant scale laws, useful formulas, fabrication guidelines, current limitations of the technology, and future developments.},

  abstract = {Surface acoustic wave atomization is promising in various kinds of industrial and pharmaceutical processes. In order to properly apply this technology for a wide range of applications, controlling the aerosol size distribution is crucial. It is widely believed that the aerosol size can be controlled by the driving frequency, our experimental results, show a rather weak frequency dependence, especially when the driving frequency is above 10 MHz. Fundamental studies were therefore carried out to determine the underlying mechanism associated with the destabilization of the liquid interface leading towards atomization with the objective of elucidating this apparent contradiction. Our investigation supports the notion that the droplet sizes appear to be governed by the capillary vibration frequency given by a balance between the capillary stress and viscous forcing, not the driving frequency as previously claimed. Furthermore, the aerosol size can be altered by controlling the surface tension and viscosity. For this case, we employ the laser diffraction to obtain the size distributions of octanol aerosol and water aerosol generated by SAW atomization. The experimental results matches our theocratical prediction that water, with higher surface tension and lower viscosity, generates relatively larger aerosols than octanol.},

Here, we present promising results using a microfluidic acoustic nebulisation platform that is not only low cost and portable, but also its high MHz order frequencies are effective for preserving the structural and functional integrity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) during the nebulisation process. This is verified through an assessment of the viability, structure, metabolic activity, proliferation ability and genetic makeup of the nebulised MSCs using a variety of assays, including cell viability staining, flow cytometry, reverse transcription and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and immunophenotyping, thus demonstrating the platform as a promising method for efficient pulmonary stem cell delivery.},

In this Perspective, we discuss computational sensing with a focus on intelligent sensor system design. By leveraging inverse design and machine learning techniques, data acquisition hardware can be fundamentally redesigned to `lock-in' to the optimal sensing data with respect to a user-defined cost function or design constraint. We envision a new generation of computational sensing systems that reduce the data burden while also improving sensing capabilities, enabling low-cost and compact sensor implementations engineered through iterative analysis of data-driven sensing outcomes. We believe that the methodologies discussed in this Perspective will permeate the design phase of sensing hardware, and thereby will fundamentally change and challenge traditional, intuition-driven sensor and readout designs in favour of application-targeted and perhaps highly non-intuitive implementations. Such computational sensors enabled by machine learning can therefore foster new and widely distributed applications that will benefit from `big data' analytics and the internet of things to create powerful sensing networks, impacting various fields, including for example, biomedical diagnostics, environmental sensing and global health, among others.},

It is designed for learning and identification not only of linear segments in two-dimensional images but also the planes and hyperplanes in the higher-dimensional spaces.

The former networks are able to encode multi-scale contextual information by probing the incoming features with filters or pooling operations at multiple rates and multiple effective fields-of-view, while the latter networks can capture sharper object boundaries by gradually recovering the spatial information. In this work, we propose to combine the advantages from both methods. Specifically, our proposed model, DeepLabv3+, extends DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet effective decoder module to refine the segmentation results especially along object boundaries. We further explore the Xception model and apply the depthwise separable convolution to both Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and decoder modules, resulting in a faster and stronger encoder-decoder network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, achieving the test set performance of 89.0\textbackslash\% and 82.1\textbackslash\% without any post-processing.

Nevertheless, the physics underlying SAW atomization is not well understood, especially in the context of thin liquid film formation and spreading and how this affects the aerosol production. Here, we demonstrate that the film geometry, governed primarily by the applied power and frequency of the SAW, indeed plays a crucial role in the atomization process and, in particular, the size of the atomized droplets. In contrast to the continuous spreading of low surface energy liquids atop similar platforms, high surface energy liquids such as water, in the present case, are found to undergo transient spreading due to the SAW to form a quasisteady film whose height is determined by self-selection of the energy minimum state associated with the acoustic resonance in the film and whose length arises from a competition between acoustic streaming and capillary effects. This is elucidated from a fundamental model for the thin film spreading behavior under SAW excitation, from which we show good agreement between the experimentally measured and theoretically predicted droplet dimension, both of which consistently indicate a linear relationship between the droplet diameter and the mechanical power coupled into the liquid by the SAW (the latter captured by an acoustic Weber number to the two thirds power, and the reciprocal of the SAW frequency).},

Object detection has benefited enormously from large-scale datasets, especially in the context of deep learning. For semantic urban scene understanding, however, no current dataset adequately captures the complexity of real-world urban scenes. To address this, we introduce Cityscapes, a benchmark suite and large-scale dataset to train and test approaches for pixel-level and instance-level semantic labeling. Cityscapes is comprised of a large, diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in streets from 50 different cities. 5000 of these images have high quality pixel-level annotations; 20000 additional images have coarse annotations to enable methods that leverage large volumes of weakly-labeled data. Crucially, our effort exceeds previous attempts in terms of dataset size, annotation richness, scene variability, and complexity. Our accompanying empirical study provides an in-depth analysis of the dataset characteristics, as well as a performance evaluation of several state-of-the-art approaches based on our benchmark.},

This article presents an algorithm for the automatic detection of circular shapes from complicated and noisy images with no consideration of conventional Hough transform (HT) principles. The proposed algorithm is based on Learning Automata (LA) which is a probabilistic optimisation method that explores an unknown random environment by progressively improving the performance via a reinforcement signal (objective function). The approach uses the encoding of three non-collinear points as a candidate circle over the edge image. A reinforcement signal (matching function) indicates if such candidate circles are actually present in the edge map. Guided by the values of such reinforcement signal, the probability set of the encoded candidate circles is modified through the LA algorithm so that they can fit to the actual circles on the edge map. Experimental results over several complex synthetic and natural images have validated the efficiency of the proposed technique regarding accuracy, speed and robustness.},

Such methods employ black-box search algorithms over image transformations with continuous or discrete parameters and require a long time to obtain better strategies. In this paper, we propose a differentiable policy search pipeline for data augmentation, which is much faster than previous methods. We introduce approximate gradients for several transformation operations with discrete parameters as well as the differentiable mechanism for selecting operations. As the objective of training, we minimize the distance between the distributions of augmented data and the original data, which can be differentiated.

This is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility of the PyTorch library. fastai includes: a new type dispatch system for Python along with a semantic type hierarchy for tensors; a GPU-optimized computer vision library which can be extended in pure Python; an optimizer which refactors out the common functionality of modern optimizers into two basic pieces, allowing optimization algorithms to be implemented in 4-5 lines of code; a novel 2-way callback system that can access any part of the data, model, or optimizer and change it at any point during training; a new data block API; and much more.

Using the SAW device, we present comprehensive experimental results exploring the complexity of the acoustic atomization process and the influence of input power, device frequency, and liquid flow rate on aerosol size distribution. It is hoped that these studies will explain the mechanism of SAW atomization aerosol generation and how they can be controlled. The insights from the high-speed flow visualization studies reveal that it is possible by setting the input power above 4.17~W, thus allowing atomization to occur from a relatively thin film, forming dense, monodisperse aerosols. Moreover, we found that the aerosol droplet size can be effectively changed by adjusting the input power and liquid flow rate to change the film conditions. In this work, we proposed a method to realize drug atomization by a microfluidic channel. A SU-8 flow channel was prepared on the surface of a piezoelectric substrate by photolithography technology.

  abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, hardly a day goes by that we do not hear about the latest advancements and improvements that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought to a wide spectrum of domains: from technology and medicine to science and sociology, and many others. AI is one of the core enabling components of the fourth industrial revolution that we are currently witnessing, and the applications of AI are truly transforming our world and impacting all facets of society, economy, living, working, and technology. The field of Instrumentation and Measurement (I\&M) is no exception, and has already been impacted by Applied AI. In this article, we give an overview of Applied AI and its usage in I\&M. We then take a deeper look at the I\&M applications of one specific AI method: Deep Learning (DL), which has recently revolutionized the field of AI. Our survey of DL papers published in the IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement (IEEE TIM) and IEEE Instrumentation \& Measurement Magazine showed that, since 2017, there is a very strong interest in applying DL methods to I\&M, in terms of measurement, calibration, and other I\&M challenges. In particular, of the 32 surveyed papers, 75\% were published in 2017 or later, and a remarkable 50\% were published in 2019 alone. Considering that 2019 was not yet finished when we were writing this article, the recent exponential interest in and impact of DL in I\&M is a very evident trend. We also found that although DL is used in a variety of I\&M topics, a considerable portion of DL in I\&M focuses on Vision Based Measurement (VBM) systems (around 28\%) and fault/defect diagnosis/detection/prediction (around 25\%). Finally, we found that Convolutional Neural Networks are the most widely used DL technique in I\&M, especially in VBM. But to explain all of the above findings, we first need to understand AI itself and what we mean by it in its applied context. So let us begin our discussion with Applied AI.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Actually, ultrasonic atomizers are rather smaller than those produced by other methods, so that nebulizers that are handy to carry use ultrasonic vibration. However, they are too large for a pocket or a catheter. A fine mist has been obtained with the first trial of a surface acoustic wave atomizing device whose dimensions are pocket size. There is a possibility of this functional device being reduced to a system of millimetre size. The atomizer consists of a vibrator, a cover and a tube. The vibrator and cover material are 127.8\textdegree{} Y-cut LiNbO     \textsubscript{3}     to generate a Rayleigh wave, a kind of surface acoustic wave. The Rayleigh wave is the driving force of the pumping and atomizing effects. The pumping effect is caused by the wave motion of the elastic material and viscosity of the fluid, like an ultrasonic motor. The atomizing rate varies according to the driving voltage. The maximum rate is about 0.6 ml min     \textsuperscript{-1}     at around 10 MHz. The linear mean diameter is 19 {$\mu$}m and the Sauter's mean diameter is 34 {$\mu$}m.

  abstract = {Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) are the guided waves that propagate along the top surface of a material with wave vectors orthogonal to the normal direction to the surface. Based on these waves, SAW sensors are conceptualized by employing piezoelectric crystals where the guided elastodynamic waves are generated through an electromechanical coupling. Electromechanical coupling in both active and passive modes is achieved by integrating interdigitated electrode transducers (IDT) with the piezoelectric crystals. Innovative meta-designs of the periodic IDTs define the functionality and application of SAW sensors. This review article presents the physics of guided surface acoustic waves and the piezoelectric materials used for designing SAW sensors. Then, how the piezoelectric materials and cuts could alter the functionality of the sensors is explained. The article summarizes a few key configurations of the electrodes and respective guidelines for generating different guided wave patterns such that new applications can be foreseen. Finally, the article explores the applications of SAW sensors and their progress in the fields of biomedical, microfluidics, chemical, and mechano-biological applications along with their crucial roles and potential plans for improvements in the long-term future in the field of science and technology.},

In this work, we provide the first definitive result in this direction for networks using the ReLU activation functions: The minimum width required for the universal approximation of the \$L\^p\$ functions is exactly \$\textbackslash max\textbackslash\{d\_x+1,d\_y\textbackslash\}\$. We also prove that the same conclusion does not hold for the uniform approximation with ReLU, but does hold with an additional threshold activation function.

  abstract = {Surface acoustic wave atomization is a rapid means for generating micron and submicron aerosol droplets. Little, however, is understood about the mechanisms by which these droplets form due to the complex hydrodynamic processes that occur across widely varying length and time scales. Through experiments, scaling theory, and simple numerical modeling, we elucidate the interfacial destabilization mechanisms that lead to droplet formation. Using a millimeter-order fluid drop exposed to surface acoustic waves as it sits atop a single-crystal lithium niobate piezoelectric substrate, large aerosol droplets on the length scale of the parent drop dimension are ejected through a whipping and pinch-off phenomenon, which occurs at the asymmetrically formed crest of the drop due to leakage of acoustic radiation at the Rayleigh angle. Smaller micron order droplets, on the other hand, are formed due to the axisymmetric breakup of cylindrical liquid jets that are ejected as a consequence of interfacial destabilization. The  10{$\mu$}m 10{$\mu$}m  droplet dimension correlates with the jet radius and the instability wavelength, both determined from a simple scaling argument involving a viscous-capillary dominant force balance. The results are further supported by numerical solution of the evolution equation governing the interfacial profile of a sessile drop along which an acoustic pressure wave is imposed. Viscous and capillary forces dominate in the bulk of the parent drop, but inertia is dominant in the ejected jets and within a thin boundary layer adjacent to the substrate where surface and interfacial accelerations are large. With the specific exception of parent drops that spread into thin films with thicknesses on the order of the boundary layer dimension prior to atomization, the free surface of the drop is always observed to vibrate at the capillary-viscous resonance frequency\textemdash even if the exciting frequency of the surface acoustic wave is several orders of magnitude larger\textemdash contrary to common assumptions used in deriving subharmonic models resulting in a Mathieu equation for the capillary wave motion, which has commonly led to erroneous predictions of the droplet size.},

Deep neural networks are usually trained with simple loss functions (e.g., softmax loss). These loss functions are appropriate for standard classification problems where the performance is measured by the overall classification accuracy. For object category segmentation, the two classes (foreground and background) are very imbalanced. The intersectionover-union (IoU) is usually used to measure the performance of any object category segmentation method. In this paper, we propose an approach for directly optimizing this IoU measure in deep neural networks. Our experimental results on two object category segmentation datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms DNNs trained with standard softmax loss.},

  abstract = {Background Pulmonary-delivered gene therapy promises to mitigate vaccine safety issues and reduce the need for needles and skilled personnel to use them. While plasmid DNA (pDNA) offers a rapid route to vaccine production without side effects or reliance on cold chain storage, its delivery to the lung has proved challenging. Conventional methods, including jet and ultrasonic nebulizers, fail to deliver large biomolecules like pDNA intact due to the shear and cavitational stresses present during nebulization. Methods In vitro structural analysis followed by in vivo protein expression studies served in assessing the integrity of the pDNA subjected to surface acoustic wave (SAW) nebulisation. In vivo immunization trials were then carried out in rats using SAW nebulized pDNA (influenza A, human hemagglutinin H1N1) condensate delivered via intratracheal instillation. Finally, in vivo pulmonary vaccinations using pDNA for influenza was nebulized and delivered via a respirator to sheep. Results The SAW nebulizer was effective at generating pDNA aerosols with sizes optimal for deep lung delivery. Successful gene expression was observed in mouse lung epithelial cells, when SAW-nebulized pDNA was delivered to male Swiss mice via intratracheal instillation. Effective systemic and mucosal antibody responses were found in rats via post-nebulized, condensed fluid instillation. Significantly, we demonstrated the suitability of the SAW nebulizer to administer unprotected pDNA encoding an influenza A virus surface glycoprotein to respirated sheep via aerosolized inhalation. Conclusion Given the difficulty of inducing functional antibody responses for DNA vaccination in large animals, we report here the first instance of successful aerosolized inhalation delivery of a pDNA vaccine in a large animal model relevant to human lung development, structure, physiology, and disease, using a novel, low-power ({$<$}1 W) surface acoustic wave (SAW) hand-held nebulizer to produce droplets of pDNA with a size range suitable for delivery to the lower respiratory airways.},

  abstract = {Semi-supervised learning (SSL) can reduce the need for large labelled datasets by incorporating unlabelled data into the training. This is particularly interesting for semantic segmentation, where labelling data is very costly and time-consuming. Current SSL approaches use an initially supervised trained model to generate predictions for unlabelled images, called pseudo-labels, which are subsequently used for training a new model from scratch. Since the predictions usually do not come from an error-free neural network, they are naturally full of errors. However, training with partially incorrect labels often reduce the final model performance. Thus, it is crucial to manage errors/noise of pseudolabels wisely. In this work, we use three mechanisms to control pseudo-label noise and errors: (1) We construct a solid base framework by mixing images with cow-patterns on unlabelled images to reduce the negative impact of wrong pseudo-labels. Nevertheless, wrong pseudo-labels still have a negative impact on the performance. Therefore, (2) we propose a simple and effective loss weighting scheme for pseudo-labels defined by the feedback of the model trained on these pseudo-labels. This allows us to soft-weight the pseudo-label training examples based on their determined confidence score during training. (3) We also study the common practice to ignore pseudo-labels with low confidence and empirically analyse the influence and effect of pseudo-labels with different confidence ranges on SSL and the contribution of pseudo-label filtering to the achievable performance gains. We show that our method performs superior to state of-the-art alternatives on various datasets. Furthermore, we show that our findings also transfer to other tasks such as human pose estimation.

  abstract = {Macroscopic spray characteristics of a fuel injection system in an internal combustion (IC) engine have a direct impact on engine performance, emissions, and combustion characteristics. Nonintrusive in-cylinder measurements provide insights into the spray formation process for greater understanding of fuel-air mixing and combustion processes in an IC engine. In this paper, there are two parts: (a) procedure and methodology to configure the Artium phase Doppler interferometer (PDI) for in situ measurements through a cylindrical window and (b) comparative macroscopic spray characteristics in a firing Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) optical engine to a constant volume spray chamber (CVSC) for spray droplet size-velocity distributions. Binned average velocity and average Sauter mean diameter of spray droplets in a firing engine were compared with that of a CVSC. Probability density function of droplet diameters in the CVSC under ambient conditions and in the engine combustion chamber provides an insight into the comparative droplet size distributions and droplet dynamics. Discussion on challenges encountered during PDI measurements in the firing engine environment, safety protocols, and tools required is also included. In addition, shadowgraphy images have been used to discuss the details on spray boundaries and spray evolution. The droplet size distribution inside the engine combustion chamber was found to be significantly different from the one observed in the CVSC. An engine simulation model can be developed/validated by using the data reported in this manuscript for attaining superior accuracy in the model. This paper describes the comparisons of the spray droplet size and velocity distributions in a CVSC and in situ for a working GDI engine. Maximum spray droplet velocity components (Vx, Vy) under engine combustion chamber conditions were 29.8 m/s, 14.2 m/s whereas the corresponding velocities in the CVSC under ambient conditions they were 78.41 m/s, 23.92 m/s, respectively, showing a large difference between the traditional measurements in the CVSC simulating engine conditions, and actual firing engine conditions. This study also reports the very first attempt in the open literature to measure spray droplet size and velocity distribution measurements in a firing IC engine.},

We find that the larger the droplets, the bigger the differences between the results obtained by the different methods. The Image Analysis VisiSizer technique yields results that are comparable with those of the stroboscopic imaging method, provided that the raw Visisizer data are used, as the VisiSizer software makes corrections that can skew the results. Our measurements confirm how the limitations of PDPA can influence its outcomes; the presence of air bubbles inside droplets will cause PDPA to mistake them for smaller droplets. The fact that PDPA reports no droplets larger than 1200 {$\mu$}m might be caused by large drops often not being spherical. The results of the laser diffraction technique are influenced by its fitting method to obtain the droplet size distribution and by overestimation of the number of small droplets due to their low velocity and thus higher concentration in the sample volume. Our results emphasize the need for selecting the size measurement technique to fit the physical nature and expected range of droplet parameters.},

This results in a dense accumulator array and problems identifying the parameter values that correspond to image features. This article proposes a new method for implementing the voting process in the HT. This method employs a competitive neural network algorithm to perform a form of probabilistic inference known as ``explaining away''. This results in a sparse accumulator array in which the parameter values of image features can be more accurately identified. The proposed method is initially demonstrated using the simple, prototypical, task of straight line detection in synthetic images. In this task it is shown to more accurately identify straight lines, and the parameter of those lines, compared to the standard Hough voting process. The proposed method is further assessed using a version of the implicit shape model (ISM) algorithm applied to car detection in natural images. In this application it is shown to more accurately identify cars, compared to using the standard Hough voting process in the same algorithm, and compared to the original ISM algorithm.},

It maintains an exponential moving average of label predictions on each training example, and penalizes predictions that are inconsistent with this target.

To overcome this problem, we propose Mean Teacher, a method that averages model weights instead of label predictions. As an additional benefit, Mean Teacher improves test accuracy and enables training with fewer labels than Temporal Ensembling. Without changing the network architecture, Mean Teacher achieves an error rate of 4.35\% on SVHN with 250 labels, outperforming Temporal Ensembling trained with 1000 labels. We also show that a good network architecture is crucial to performance.

Such atomizers also show great potential for on-chip integration and can lead to economic production of hand-held and even disposable devices, with either a single functionality or integrated in more complex superior systems. However, this potential was limited in the past by fluid supply mechanisms inadequate for mass production, accuracy and reliability. In this work, we briefly discuss existing fluid supply methods and demonstrate a straightforward new approach suited for reliable and cost-effective mass-scale manufacturing of SAW atomizer chips.

  abstract = {Regional dropout strategies have been proposed to enhance the performance of convolutional neural network classifiers. They have proved to be effective for guiding the model to attend on less discriminative parts of objects (e.g. leg as opposed to head of a person), thereby letting the network generalize better and have better object localization capabilities. On the other hand, current methods for regional dropout remove informative pixels on training images by overlaying a patch of either black pixels or random noise. Such removal is not desirable because it leads to information loss and inefficiency during training. We therefore propose the CutMix augmentation strategy: patches are cut and pasted among training images where the ground truth labels are also mixed proportionally to the area of the patches. By making efficient use of training pixels and retaining the regularization effect of regional dropout, CutMix consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art augmentation strategies on CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, as well as on the ImageNet weakly-supervised localization task. Moreover, unlike previous augmentation methods, our CutMix-trained ImageNet classifier, when used as a pretrained model, results in consistent performance gains in Pascal detection and MS-COCO image captioning benchmarks. We also show that CutMix improves the model robustness against input corruptions and its out-of-distribution detection performances.
