Basic steps such as optimizing parameters for training are not the only methods available to try to improve the performance of the resulting model. 
Other techniques may be used to achieve better results, either by facilitating learning in some way or exploiting more data. 
In the following sections, the techniques employed during model development in this thesis will be explained more in depth.
